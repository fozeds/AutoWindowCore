# AutoWindowFinder Core

Just trying to create a "core" that can click and perform actions based on images and videos, quickly, like copying, pasting the PNG, and defining the action.


## How to Get Started

1. Start:
    ```python
    my_tree = TreeFinder()
    my_tree.i_dont_know_choose_a_method_for_you()
    ```
